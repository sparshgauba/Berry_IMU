Berry IMU Sensor Fusion Library for Raspberry Pi

Uses MadgwickAHRS filter along with BerryIMU's library to determine
the orientation of the device.

compass_calib.c outputs the calibration values for the magnetometer.

calib.c outputs the roll, pitch and yaw angles in radians to stdout
in CSV format.

term_out.py executes calib program, parses its output, and converts the
orientation angles into degrees.

BerryIMU.py sends data to the rest of the Zombie_Archer system.
