Berry IMU Sensor Fusion Library for Raspberry Pi

Uses MadgwickAHRS filter along with BerryIMU's library to determine
the orientation of the device.

compass_calib.c outputs the calibration values for the magnetometer.

calib.c outputs the roll, pitch and yaw angles in radians to stdout
in CSV format.

in.py executes calib program, parses its output, and converts the
orientation angles into degrees.
